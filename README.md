Cryptography Research Source Files.

One of the best sources of documentation I have been able to find on the subject of One Time Pad's - hosted here for my own reference.

The Current source URL is: https://www.ciphermachinesandcryptology.com/papers/one_time_pad.pdf

The origional source website seems to have changed domains. Older editions of the paper that are printed out for reference no longer point to the correct source material url.
